    "comments": ["Excellent overall. Two comments for improvement. 1. In areas of intermittent poor reception, zoom has trouble reconnecting, and under such circumstances it should prioritise sound, at low bit rate, and increase quality as signal improves and then add video. 2. When connecting via Bluetooth in my car, the sound seems to get channeled via the \"telephone\" function of the car radio, and not the Bluetooth audio. This is a poorer quality sound output.",
        "I was never a fan of anything video until introduced to zoom. It's not only one of the leading video conference apps available but in my opinion, one of the best. More importantly, it's extremely user friendly and designed for ALL types of professional business savey people and businesses and students. The updates are amazing and developed in a way to allow Zoom to go as far as someone takes it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great, well rounded & super fun video chat experience!☆",
        "I've used Zoom for a business network group spread across the US & Canada and it has allowed us to meet and discuss issues weekly. ... Almost like having a face to face. Being able to share screens and computer program info was especially helpful. I've also used it for personal conversations with friends and family. Rather fun to introduce them to this technology. Simple and intuitive to use.",
        "Most reliable and complete conference call app. Been using this for years and it never fails me. Battery & data consumption is quite high",
        "You could use a better UI on PC, especially on Mac/Linux. Other than that, probably the most enjoyable video conference tool Ive I've ever used."
